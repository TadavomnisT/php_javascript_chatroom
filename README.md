# Chatroom using PHP and JavaScrip
# Socket Programming

Hey there!

I've scripted a simple server confuguration in PHP in order to handle a simple chatroom with several clients from JavaScript and HTML or any other GUI that can connect to a URL's specific port.
I used the socket programming architecture and configured server on port number ```15000``` .
This server and client can be used in purpose of learning socket programming and networks.
I used json ecoding along side with WebSocket protocol in JavaScript and PHP

## Usage
* Simply just use :
```
git clone https://github.com/TadavomnisT/php_javascript_chatroom.git
```
or

* directly in PHP :
```php
    if (!file_exists('testWatermark.php'))
    copy('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TadavomnisT/php_image_watermark/master/test.php', 'testWatermark.php');
```

Then run 'server.php' and open 'client.html' in browser and start chatting :)

```
cd php_javascript_chatroom
php server.php
```
